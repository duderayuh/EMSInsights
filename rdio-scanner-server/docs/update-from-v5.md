# Updating from version 5

[Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) has its server component completely rewritten in [GO](https://go.dev). Therefore, it is no longer possible to upgrade to version 6 as with previous versions.

You need to download the latest Rdio Scanner release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner/releases) on the [main page](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner).

> REMEMBER TO ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFORE ATTEMPTING AN UPDATE.

## Update steps for the standard sqlite database
