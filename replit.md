# EMS-Insight - Emergency Dispatch Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

EMS-Insight is a real-time emergency dispatch monitoring system designed to process SDRTrunk audio feeds, transcribe calls using AI, and provide comprehensive analytics through an interactive web dashboard. The system is built for Indianapolis-Marion County EMS dispatch channels with architecture designed for future multi-city expansion.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live data streaming
- **Mapping**: Leaflet for interactive geographic visualization
- **Charts**: Plotly for statistical analysis and trend visualization

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket support
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg for audio manipulation and segmentation
- **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper (local or cloud-based)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for live updates

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for database operations
- **Vector Storage**: pgvector for text embedding similarity search
- **Audio Files**: Local filesystem storage for audio segments

## Key Components

### Audio Processing Pipeline
- **Audio Ingestion**: Continuous processing of SDRTrunk UDP/pipe audio feeds
- **Segmentation**: 30-second audio chunks with timestamp tracking
- **Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper API (primary) and local Whisper (fallback) for word-for-word verbatim speech-to-text
- **Storage**: Organized audio segment storage with metadata

### AI Classification System
- **NLP Pipeline**: Custom classification using keyword detection
- **Call Type Detection**: Automatic categorization (medical, fire, MVC, etc.)
- **Text Similarity**: Vector embeddings for finding similar incidents
- **Keyword Extraction**: Configurable keyword spotting system

### Real-time Dashboard
- **Live Feed**: Real-time call updates via WebSocket
- **Interactive Map**: Geographic visualization of emergency locations
- **Analytics**: Statistical analysis with trend detection
- **Search**: Full-text search and similarity-based incident matching
- **Filtering**: Priority-based and type-based call filtering

### WebSocket Service
- **Real-time Updates**: Live streaming of new calls and system status
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and heartbeat monitoring
- **Data Broadcasting**: Efficient distribution of updates to connected clients

## Data Flow

1. **Audio Ingestion**: SDRTrunk audio stream → Audio Processor
2. **Segmentation**: Audio chunks → File storage with metadata
3. **Transcription**: Audio segments → OpenAI Whisper API (primary) or Local Whisper (fallback) → Word-for-word verbatim transcripts
4. **Classification**: Verbatim transcripts → NLP Classifier → Call metadata
5. **Storage**: Structured data → PostgreSQL, embeddings → pgvector
6. **Real-time Updates**: New calls → WebSocket → Dashboard updates
7. **Analytics**: Historical data → Trend analysis → Dashboard visualization

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with pgvector extension
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Local speech-to-text transcription using system-installed Whisper
- **No AI Cleanup**: Removed for word-for-word verbatim transcription accuracy
- **SDRTrunk**: Audio feed source for emergency dispatch channels
- **Rdio Scanner Database**: Read-only SQLite database (rdio-scanner.db) containing audio files - **NEVER modify this file**

### CRITICAL DATABASE INTEGRITY RULE
**⚠️ NEVER EVER REMOVE OR MODIFY AUDIO FROM rdio-scanner.db FILE ⚠️**
- The rdio-scanner.db file is **READ-ONLY** and must never be modified
- Audio files are stored in the database and should never be deleted
- The system only reads from this database to serve audio content
- Any modification to this file will corrupt the audio storage system
- This is a fundamental requirement for audio playback functionality

### Development Tools
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database schema management and migrations
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type checking and compilation

### Optional Services
- **Neon Database**: Managed PostgreSQL hosting option
- **Cloud APIs**: Fallback services for transcription and AI processing (currently using local Whisper and Anthropic Claude API)

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Deployment
- **Container Environment**: Optimized for Replit's container system
- **One-click Run**: Simplified deployment via npm scripts
- **Environment Variables**: Database connection and API keys
- **Auto-scaling**: Designed for Replit's scaling capabilities

### Local Development
- **Docker Compose**: Optional containerized development environment
- **Development Server**: Hot-reload enabled development setup
- **Database Management**: Local PostgreSQL with pgvector extension

### Production Considerations
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate development/production configs
- **Static Asset Serving**: Optimized build output serving
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time data processing
